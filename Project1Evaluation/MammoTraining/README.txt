This file contains information regarding project 1 of the final project.

In the attached zip file are 2D slices of the mammograms of 21 subjects and the masks for subjects with disease. There are 42 scans and 14 masks in total.

Subjects are named by a 4-digit code followed by "_LEFT" or "_RIGHT" indicating the side of the scan.
(E.g. "2002_LEFT.png" is the image of the left breast for subject #2002. "2002_LEFT_MASK.png" is the mask image for subject #2002.)

The file "Project1List.xlsx" contains the subject IDs for all subjects and their diagnosis for both sides of the breast.

You can use MATLAB function "imread" to load the subject images or the mask.
